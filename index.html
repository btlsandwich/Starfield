		    The universe has a beginning, but no end. Infinite. Stars, too, have their own beginnings, but their own power results
		    in their destruction. Finite. It is those who possess wisdom who are the greatest fools. History has shown us this. It can be said
		    that this is a final ultimatum from the god to the people who can fight.
